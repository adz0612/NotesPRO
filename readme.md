Our application aims to make it easier for students / working professionals to search through their notes eaiser. 
One can also listen to their notes just by taking a picture for quickly revising stuff on the go.

# Use Cases:

1. It isn't adviced to read books while travelling as it strains our eyes. notesPRO can be used here too. You can **listen** to your notes on the go. Just take a pic of your notes 
**[ Handwritten / Typed ]** and notesPRO will extract the text and read it out to you.

2. Sometimes, while in a hurry, we are looking for just that one thing in our notes and we just can't find it. With notesPRO, you can: 

* Take a pic of your notes ---> *notesPRO* converts it to an editable text --> You can search through this text and notesPRO will highlight what you were looking for :D
